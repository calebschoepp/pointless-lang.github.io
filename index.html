  Pointless: A Scripting Language for Learning and Fun (v0.1.0)

<div id="whyPointless">
  <h3>Why Learn Pointless?</h3>

  <p>What language should beginner programmers learn? Pointless, of course!</p>

  <p>
    Here's the deal: I like the way that writing programs in scripting languages (like Python) tends to feel -- easy and flexible -- and I like the types of programs that functional languages (like Haskell) are designed to produce -- declarative and correct. But Python and Haskell are very different languages -- is there a middle-ground between the two? Pointless aims to provide just this.

  <h4>Comparison with Scripting Languages:</h4>

  <p>
    Scripting languages are often seen as flexible and easy to use. My own experience has show me that languages which are easy to use also make it easy to write bad programs. One of the primary goals of Pointless ...

  Pointless 0.1.0 brings a number of changes from the initial release, informed by 
  feedback and experience. The latest implementation of Pointless is interpreted, rather than compiled, and is written in Dart. This move marks a deemphasis on performance with a focus instead on improved language design and faster development. It's my hope that the new Dart-based implementation will make Pointless easier for others to <a href="install.html">install</a>, <a href="online">use</a>, and <a href="dev.html">modify</a>.

  <li>Explicit exports for multi-file projects</li>
  <li>Expanded standard library</li>
  <li>Try / Catch error handling mechanism</li>
  <li>Support for labeled objects</li>
</ul>

<strong>Implementation updates:</strong>

  <li>A smaller, easier to edit codebase</li>
  <li>Improved Windows support</li>
  <li>Bug fixes</li>
  <li>MIT licensed source code</li>
</ul>

<strong>Site updates:</strong>

  I've made this site to share a project I've been working on intermittently for the last couple of years -- a programming language called Pointless. The language is a distillation of some of the concepts from functional programming that I find interesting, with a design goal that can be roughly summarized as "creating the programming language that I'd like to have learned as a beginner programmer". This language is still very much in-the-works, but I'm excited to share the progress that I've made so far.
